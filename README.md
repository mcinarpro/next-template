# Next.js Template Starter

This is a template project built with Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, and the Shadcn-ui
component library. It provides a modern development setup for quickly building
and deploying web applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14**: A powerful React framework with built-in server-side rendering
  and static site generation capabilities.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom
  user interfaces.
- **Shadcn**: A comprehensive component library designed to work seamlessly with
  React and TailwindCSS, providing a set of pre-designed components to
  accelerate development.
- **Geist Font**: A sleek and modern font to enhance the visual appeal of your
  project.
- **Lucide Icons**: A collection of beautiful and customizable icons, designed
  to be consistent and pixel-perfect.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses
[`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to
automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
